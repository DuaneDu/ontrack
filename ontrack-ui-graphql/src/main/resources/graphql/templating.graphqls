Request for the export of a change log.

This request defines how to group issues by type and which format
to use for the export.

If no grouping is specified, the issues will be returned as a list, without any grouping.

The exclude field is used to exclude some issues from the export using their type.

Note that both the export format and the type of issues are specific notions linked to the issue service
(JIRA, GitHub...) that produces the issues.

    Specification for the grouping, none by default.

    This specification describes how to group issues using their type. This format is independent from
    the issue service and this service is responsible for the actual mapping of issue "types" into actual
    issue fields. For example, for GitHub, an issue type is mapped on a label.
    The format of the specification is:

    ----
    specification := "" | ${'$'}group ( "|" ${'$'}group)*
    group         := ${'$'}name "=" ${'$'}type ( "," ${'$'}type)*
    ----

    For example:

    ----
    Bugs=bug|Features=feature,enhancement
    ----

    Any issue that would not be mapped in a group will be assigned arbitrarily to the group defined by
    altGroup property.

    If the specification is empty, no grouping will be done.

    If left empty, any issue not belonging to a group would be excluded from the export. This field
    is not used when no grouping is specified.
