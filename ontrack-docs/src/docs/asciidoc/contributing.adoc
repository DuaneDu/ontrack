=== Branching strategy

The branching strategy used for Ontrack is based on
the https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model[Git Flow].

* development of features always goes to `feature/` branches created
  from the `develop` branch
* new releases are created by branching from the `develop` branch,
  using `release/` as a prefix
* pull requests must be made from the `develop` branch
* the `master` branch contains an image of the latest release - no
  development is done on it

The versioning is automated using the
https://github.com/nemerosa/versioning[Gradle Versioning plug-in]. No file
needs to be updated to set the version.
