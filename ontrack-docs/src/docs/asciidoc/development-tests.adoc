==== Database integration tests

While the vast majority of tests might never need to interact directly with the database, some tests may need a direct JDBC access to it.

For example, for a migration test, we cannot use the normal API to insert test records into the database, since the API is already up-to-date. A typical scenario would be then:

1. insert some records into the database using JDBC
2. run the migration
3. use the API to check everything is OK

For the rest, this type of test will be coded as any other <<development-test-integration,integration test>>.

To run JDBC statements directly, use the `jdbcTemplate` property or the `namedJdbcTemplate` one, made available by the `AbstractITTestSupport` class or one of its subclass.

Example: `GitHubConfigurationTokenMigrationIT`
