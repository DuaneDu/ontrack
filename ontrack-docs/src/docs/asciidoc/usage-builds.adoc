[[builds]]
=== Managing the builds

The builds are displayed for a <<model,branch>>.

[[builds-filtering]]
==== Filtering the builds

By default, only the 10 last builds of a branch are shown but you have the
possibility to create _build filters_ in order to change the list of displayed
builds for a branch.

The management of filters is done using the _Filter_ buttons at the top-left
and bottom-left corners of the build list. Those buttons behave exactly the
same way. They are not displayed if no build has ever been created for the
branch.

Some filters, like _Last build per promotion_, are predefined, and you just
have to select them to apply them.

You can create custom filters using the _build filter types_ which are in the
_New filter_ section at the end of the _Filter_ menu. You fill in the filter
parameters and
apply the filter by clicking on _OK_.

If you give your filter a name, this filter will be saved locally for the
current branch and can be reused later on when using the same browser on the
same machine account. If you are logged, you can save this filter for your
account at _ontrack_ level so you can reuse it from any workstation.

If the filter is not named, it will be applied all the same but won't be
editable nor being able to be saved.

You can delete and edit any of your own filters.

You can disable any filtering by selection _Erase filter_. You would then
return to the default: last 10 builds. Note that the saved filters are not
impacted by this operation.

[[builds-filtering-sharing]]
===== Sharing filters

By selecting the _Permalink_ option in the _Filter_ menu, you update your
browser's URL to include information about the current selected filter. By
copying this URL and send to another user, this other user will be able to
apply the same filter than you, even if he did not create it in the first place.

Even anonymous (unnamed) filters can be shared this way.

[[builds-links]]
==== Build links

A <<model,build>> can be linked to other builds. This is particularly useful
to represent dependencies between builds and projects.

[[builds-links-definition]]
===== Definition of links

If authorized, you'll see a _Build links_ command at the top of the build page:

image::images/property-build-links-command.png[Build links command,400]

Clicking on this link will open a dialog which allows you to define the list
of links:

image::images/property-build-links-dialog.png[Build links input,400]

Note that:

* usually, you'll probably edit those links in an automated process using the
  <<dsl,DSL>>
* you cannot define or see links to builds for which the project is not
  accessible to you

[[builds-links-decorations]]
===== Decorations

The build links are displayed as decorations in the build page header:

image::images/property-build-links-decoration-header.png[Build links decorations in header,400]

or in the list of builds:

image::images/property-build-links-decoration-list.png[Build links decorations in list,400]

In both cases, the decoration is clickable. If the target build has been
promoted, the associated promotions will also be displayed.

image::images/property-build-links-decoration-promotions.png[Build links promotions,400]

[NOTE]
====
If the target project (the project containing the build targeted by
the link) has been <<property-build-link-display-options,configured accordingly>>,
the _label_ associated to the build will be displayed instead of its
name.
====

[TIP]
====
When the list of dependencies becomes too big, the decoration can
be more cumbersome than useful. See the <<builds-links-filtering>> section
below on tips for customizing the display of the decoration.
====

[[builds-links-information]]
===== Information

The builds which are linked to a given build or which are used
by this build are displayed on the
build page:

image::images/builds-links-information.png[Build links information,100%]

[[builds-links-querying]]
===== Querying

The build links properties can be used for queries:

* in <<builds-filtering,build filters>>
* in build searches
* in global searches

In all those cases, the syntax to find a match is:

* `project`, `project:` or `project:*` - all builds which contain a build link
  to the `project` <<projects,project>>
* `project:build` - all builds which contain a link to the build `build` in
  the `project` project
* `project:build*` - all builds which contain a link to a build starting with
  `build` in the `project` project. The `*` wildcard can be used in any place.

[[builds-links-filtering]]
===== Filtering the build links

Once a build has too many dependencies, the <<builds-links-decorations,decoration>>
is too cluttered and cannot be used correctly:

image::images/builds-links-filtering-clutter.png[Build links decoration cluttered,100%]

In order to reduce this clutter, you can act at several levels:

* setting some global property to so that only "main" build links are displayed

====
Only the <<security,administrators>> can set those global settings. Navigate to the _Settings_
in the user menu, navigate to _Main build links_ and edit the _Project labels_.

image::images/builds-links-filtering-global-settings.png[Global main build links,400]

Enter a list of <<projects-labels,project labels>> which will be considered as "main links"
and must _always_ be displayed in the build decoration.
====

* setting the project so that only "main" build links are displayed. Optionally, the global
  settings can be overridden.

====
In the source project (the one having the builds with many links to other projects),
add the "Main build links" property and edit the list of the <<projects-labels,labels>> designated the projects
to be always displayed.

image::images/builds-links-filtering-project-settings.png[Project main build links,400]

By default, the global settings and the project settings are merged together. You can override this
behaviour and take into account only the project settings by checking the "Override global settings"
checkbox.
====

Given a project `source` whose one build depends on `product`(labeled with `main`),
`library` (labeled `module`) and many other projects, if one sets the following settings:

* global settings: `main`
* project `source` settings: `module` and no override

Then, only the `product` dependency is displayed in the decoration:

image::images/builds-links-filtered-reduced-decoration.png[Reduced decoration,300]

TIP: The last link icon is a link allowing to navigate to the source build and list
all dependencies. If the source build would have dependencies which are not flagged
as "main builds", only this icon would appear.

[[builds-run-info]]
==== Run info

Builds can be associated with some <<model,run info>> which contains
details about the source, the trigger and the duration of this build.

Information about the duration of the builds is shown just right
of the build name in the branch page:

image::images/builds-run-info-overview.png[Build run info,400]

or in the list of extensions in the build page:

image::images/builds-run-info-detail.png[Build run info,400]

More details about run information at <<run-info>>.
