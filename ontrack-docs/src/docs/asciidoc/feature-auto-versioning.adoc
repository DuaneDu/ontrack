=== Auto versioning on promotion

Beside collecting data about the performance of your delivery, Ontrack can in turn use this information to drive other automation processes.

One of these processes that Ontrack can drive is the "auto promotion on promotion", which allows the propagation of versions from one repository to others using quality gates based on Ontrack <<model,promotions>>.

Let's imagine a project `parent` which has a dependency on a `module` expressed through a version property somewhere in a file.

Ideally, whenever the `module` has a new version is a given range, we want this version to be used automatically by the `parent`.

Manually, we can do this of course:

* we update the version in the `parent`
* we perform any needed post-processing like a resolution of locks
* we commit and push the change. Voil√†.

If we put extra automation in the mix, you can define a perfectly valid auto versioning process.

This becomes more complex whenever having a new version of the `module` is not enough of a criteria to have it used. This may be a release which has not been qualified yet by extra quality processes (long running ones maybe).

That's where the concept of <<model,promotion>> in Ontrack can play a very important rule:

* the `module` is promoted
* this starts the following process:
  * Ontrack creates a pull request for the `parent` where the version of the `module` has been changed to the one being promoted
  * any required post processing is performed on this PR
  * when the PR is ready to be merged (with all its controls), it's merged automatically

Result:

* versions are propagated automatically only when "promotion gates" are opened

This is valid from one module to a project, and can be easily extended to a full tree of dependent modules.

The diagram below shows how this works:

[[auto-versioning-not]]
==== When not to use auto versioning

While auto versioning is pretty easy to put in place, it should not be used where traditional dependency management based on locks can be used instead for simple code libraries.

Auto versioning on promotion is however particularly well suited to deal with situations like:

* modular monoliths
* GitOps repositories with fixed versions

[[auto-versioning-settings]]
==== General configuration

Auto versioning is not enabled by default. This can be done in the _Settings > Auto Versioning_.

Three parameters are available:

* _Enabled_ - check to enable auto versioning
* _Audit retention_ - maximum number of seconds to keep non-running audit entries for auto versioning requests (see <<auto-versioning-audit>> for more information)
* _Audit cleanup_ - maximum number of seconds to keep audit entries for auto versioning requests. This time is counted after the retention period for the non-running entries  (see <<auto-versioning-audit>> for more information)

[NOTE]
====
These settings can also be <<casc,configured as code>>. For example using:

[source,yaml]
----
ontrack:
  config:
    settings:
      auto-versioning:
        enabled: true
        auditRetentionDuration: 14d
        auditCleanupDuration: 90d
