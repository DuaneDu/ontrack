== Quick start

The fastest way to start Ontrack is to use Docker Compose:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack/blob/{ontrack-version}/compose/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
----

This sets up:

* a Postgres database
* an ElasticSearch (single node)
* Ontrack running on port 8080

Go to http://localhost:8080 and start using Ontrack.

The initial administrator credentials are `admin` / `admin`.

Where to go from there?

* learn how to <<feeding,feed information>> into Ontrack
* learn how to <<usage,use the Ontrack UI>>
* ... or to use its <<api>>
