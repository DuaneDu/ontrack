* and all the connections that Ontrack holds for projects

[[administration-management-rest]]
==== REST info

The `/rest/info` REST end point returns basic information:

[source,json]

{
  "_self": "/rest/info/",
  "version": {
    "date": "2021-04-29T11:15:20.271757Z",

[[administration-management-actuator]]
==== Actuator end points

Ontrack exposes Spring Boot actuator end points:

* over HTTP (JMX is disabled)
* port `8800`
* on `/manage` context path

[NOTE]
====
The management port can be configured using the default `management.server.port` system property or `MANAGEMENT_SERVER_PORT` environment variable.
====

[CAUTION]
====
The management end points authentication is disabled by default in Ontrack, so make sure the chosen port (`8800` by default) is not exposed unnecessarily or enable authentication.

Check the Spring Boot documentation for more information.
====

The following end points are exposed by default:

* `/manage/health` - health of Ontrack and its components
* `/manage/info` - basic information about the Ontrack instance
* `/manage/prometheus` - exposes environment metrics for being consumed by Prometheus

Additionally, custom management end points are available:

* `/manage/influxdb` - if <<operations-metrics-influxdb,InfluxDB integration>> is enabled. The `GET` method returns the status of the connection between Ontrack and InfluxDB, and the `POST` method forces a reconnection. See <<operations-metrics-influxdb>> for more information.

* `/manage/connectors` - the connectors are used to connect to external systems like Jenkins, JIRA, Git repositories, etc. The `manage/connectors` end point allows an <<security,administrator>> to get information about the state of those connectors.

* `/manage/account` - `POST` method to reset the password of a given account by name, for example:

[source]
----
POST /manage/account

{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "new-password"
}
----

This returns `true` or `false` to show the success of the operation.
