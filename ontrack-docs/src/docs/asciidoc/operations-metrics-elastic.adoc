=== Elastic metrics

To enable the export of metrics into Elastic, set the `ontrack.extension.elastic.metrics.enabled` <<configuration-properties,configuration property>> to `true`.

This will send Ontrack <<monitoring,metrics>> to Elastic in a unique index following https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-field-reference.html[ECS] conventions.

See <<configuration-properties-elastic>> for the configuration of this export to Elastic.

When this export of metrics to Elastic is enabled, Ontrack will provide operational metrics about this export, typically available in Prometheus:

* `ontrack_extension_elastic_metrics_queue` - current size of the queue
* `ontrack_extension_elastic_metrics_buffer` - current size of the buffer
