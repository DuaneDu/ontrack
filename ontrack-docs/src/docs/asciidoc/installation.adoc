//
//[[installation-postgres]]
//=== Postgres database
//
//Unless you choose to deploy with <<installation-docker-compose,Docker Compose>>,
//you will need to have a Postgres database accessible by Ontrack.
//
//Version 9.5 of Postgres has been tested successfully with Ontrack, but
//any later 9.x version should be OK as well.
//
//No test with Postgres 10.x has been performed yet.
//
//Ontrack will by default try to connect to
//`jdbc:postgresql://postgresql/ontrack`, using `ontrack / ontrack`
//as credentials.
//
//Those parameters can be configured using normal Spring Boot JDBC <<configuration,configuration>>,
//for example using arguments at startup:
//
//[source]
//----
//--spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ontrack
//--spring.datasource.username=myuser
//--spring.datasource.password=password
//----
//
//See the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.8.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config[Spring Boot documentation]
//to see other and better ways to pass
//those <<configuration,configuration>> parameters.
