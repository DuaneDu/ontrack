== Feeding information in Ontrack

Ontrack gathers and structures information which is sent by other tools in a CI/CD ecosystem or collected from them.

Foremost among the tools which will feed information into Ontrack are the CI engines. They can initialize projects and branches, they can create builds, validations and promotions, they can inject meta-information like timings, test results or links between builds.

NOTE: Ontrack gathers also information out of ticketing systems, artifact managers or source control systems. This aspect is covered in the <<integrations>> chapter.

Ontrack provides an <<feeding-api,API>> for tools to inject data, but more specialized integrations are provided as well:

* the <<feeding-cli,Ontrack CLI>>
* the <<feeding-jenkins,Ontrack Jenkins plug-in>>
* a set of <<feeding-github,Ontrack GitHub actions>>
