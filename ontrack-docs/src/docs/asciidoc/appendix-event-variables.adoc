=== Event variables

Events which can be <<notifications,subscribed>> to contain variables which can be used in some channels to render some values (see <<integration-jenkins-notifications>> for example).

For each available variable, case variants are available. For example, for the name of a project linked to an event:

* `+{PROJECT}+` will use the uppercase version
* `+{project}+` will use the lowercase version
* `+{Project}+` will use the raw value

[NOTE]
====
Filters can also be used instead, see below.

[[appendix-event-variables-filters]]
==== Filters

Filters can be added to the expressions to alter the actual values:

[source]
----
{name|filter}
----

For example, `{Project|urlencode}` will encode the name of the project to be suitable into a URL.

|===
| Filter | Description

| `urlencode`
| Encodes the value for a URL

| `uppercase`
| Converts the value to uppercase. `{Project\|uppercase}` is equivalent to `+{PROJECT}+`

| `lowercase`
| Converts the value to lowercase. `{Project\|lowercase}` is equivalent to `+{project}+`
