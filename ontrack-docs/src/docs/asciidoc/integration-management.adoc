[[integration-management]]
=== Management end point

Ontrack exposes additional Spring Boot actuator end points.

[[integration-management-connectors]]
==== Connectors

The connectors are used to connect to external systems like Jenkins,
JIRA, Git repositories, etc. The `manage/connectors` end point allows an
<<security,administrator>> to get information about the state of those
connectors.

NOTE: The connector statuses are also exposed as <<integration-metrics,metrics>>.
