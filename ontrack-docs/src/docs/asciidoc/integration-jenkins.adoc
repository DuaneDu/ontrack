=== Integration with Jenkins

Jenkins can inject data into Ontrack - see <<feeding-jenkins>> for this purpose. But Ontrack can also link builds to Jenkins by:

* defining a Jenkins configuration
* setting a link to a Jenkins folder at project or branch level
* setting a link to a Jenkins build at build level
