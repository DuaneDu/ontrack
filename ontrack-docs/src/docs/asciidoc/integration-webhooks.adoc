[[webhooks]]
=== Webhooks

Ontrack can be configured to send <<notifications,notifications>> to some webhooks using HTTP.

[WARNING]
====
Webhooks are disabled by default and must be enabled explicitly.
See <<webhooks-settings,global settings>>.
====

[[webhooks-definitions]]
==== Definitions

Ontrack administrators can create webhooks using the _Webhooks_ entry in their user menu.

Webhooks can be created and deleted.

A webhook is defined by the following fields:

* name - a unique name for the webhook, which will be referred to when used in a subscription
* enabled - a flag to disable or enable the webhook
* url - a HTTP URL for the webhook.
HTTPS is recommended but not required.
* timeout - number of seconds to wait before the connection to the webhook _url_ is abandoned (see also <<webhooks-timeouts,timeouts>> below)
* _authentication_ - the way to authenticate to the webhook (see <<webhooks-authentication,below>>)

[[webhooks-authentication]]
==== Authentication

Three types of authentication are supported:

* basic authentication - a username and a password must be provided
* bearer authentication - a token must be provided and will be sent in the `Authorization` header with its value set to `Bearer <provided token>`
* header authentication - a header name and value must be provided

[NOTE]
====
Authentication of webhooks is required.
====

[[webhooks-timeouts]]
==== Timeouts

Timeouts for the execution of the webhooks are defined at two levels:

* <<webhooks-settings,global settings>>
* <<webhooks-definitions,webhook definition>>

The actual timeout is the _maximum_ value between these two values.

[[webhooks-settings]]
==== Global settings

The _Webhooks_ section in the global settings allows the configuration of the following:

* enabled - global flag used for _all_ webhooks - set to _No_ by default
* timeout - number of minutes for the <<webhooks-timeouts,global timeout>> - set to 5 minutes by default
* retention days for the deliveries - number of days to keep the <<webhooks-deliveries,webhooks deliveries records>> - set to 30 days by default

[WARNING]
====
Webhooks are disabled by default and must be enabled explicitly.
====

[[webhooks-deliveries]]
==== Webhooks deliveries

Additionally to the <<notifications-recordings,notification recordings>>, deliveries to the webhooks are also registered by Ontrack and accessible by an administrator.

The deliveries for a given webhook are accessible through the _Deliveries_ button on the list of webhooks.

image::integration-webhooks-deliveries.png[Webhook deliveries]

The following columns are displayed:

* unique ID for the delivery
* name of the webhook
* timestamp of the _request_
* type of payload
* HTTP status sent by the remote webhook

You can get more details by clicking on the UUID or the eye icon:

* request payload - the JSON actually sent to the webhook
* response payload - the payload returned by the webhook (interpreted as text)
* response timestamp - when the response was received
* stack - the error stacktrace in case of error

[[webhooks-payloads]]
==== Payloads

Several types of payloads can be sent by Ontrack but they all share the same structure:

* type: `application/json`
* schema:

[source,json]
----
{
  "uuid" : "<uuid>",
  "type" : "<payload type>",
  "data" : {}
}
----

The `data` node type and content depends on the payload `type`.

[[webhooks-payloads-events]]
===== `event` payload

The `event` payload is sent upon a <<notifications,notification>>.
A typical payload looks like:

[source,json]
----
{
  "uuid" : "fcf07059-6158-4acc-a965-9cbf30c8bdd7",
  "type" : "event",
  "data" : {
    "eventType" : {
      "id" : "new_branch",
      "template" : "New branch ${BRANCH} for project ${PROJECT}."
    },
    "signature" : null,
    "entities" : {
      "PROJECT" : {
        "id" : 260,
        "name" : "p42127192",
        "description" : "",
        "disabled" : false,
        "signature" : {
          "time" : "2022-05-02T07:42:12.751100Z",
          "user" : {
            "name" : "admin"
          }
        }
      },
      "BRANCH" : {
        "id" : 154,
        "name" : "b42128333",
        "description" : "",
        "disabled" : false,
        "project" : {
          "id" : 260,
          "name" : "p42127192",
          "description" : "",
          "disabled" : false,
          "signature" : {
            "time" : "2022-05-02T07:42:12.751100Z",
            "user" : {
              "name" : "admin"
            }
          }
        },
        "signature" : {
          "time" : "2022-05-02T07:42:12.862900Z",
          "user" : {
            "name" : "admin"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "ref" : null,
    "values" : { }
  }
}
----

The `entities`, `ref` and `values` fields will vary a lot depending on the type of event.

[[webhooks-payloads-pings]]
===== `ping` payload

A `ping` payload can be sent from the webhooks list by clicking on the _Test_ button.

It's used to test a webhook and its payload looks like:

[source,json]
----
{
  "uuid" : "b438b771-e20c-4012-adf6-adb0f1aaa43b",
  "type" : "ping",
  "data" : {
    "message" : "Webhook wh48546511 ping"
  }
}
----
