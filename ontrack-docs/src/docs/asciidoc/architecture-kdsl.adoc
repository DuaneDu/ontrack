[[kdsl]]
==== Kotlin DSL

The Kotlin DSL allows clients to easily interact
with Ontrack using a typed DSL based on HTTP interactions
(GraphQL or REST).

[WARNING]
====
The Kotlin DSL replaces the Groovy DSL which was shipped in previous versions. The main
advantages of the Kotlin-based DSL are:

* type-safe DSL
* extensibility
