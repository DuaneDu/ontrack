==== Kotlin DSL

The Kotlin DSL allows clients to easily interact
with Ontrack using a typed DSL based on HTTP interactions
(GraphQL or REST).

[WARNING]
====
The Kotlin DSL replaces the Groovy DSL which was shipped in previous versions. The main
advantages of the Kotlin-based DSL are:

* type-safe DSL
* extensibility

===== KDSL Principles

Methods of the KDSL are based on the two following principles:

* using a verb for actions with a clear semantic, like creating a project, `createProject`
* using the entity name for methods which create an entity when needed or returning an existing one, lik `project`
