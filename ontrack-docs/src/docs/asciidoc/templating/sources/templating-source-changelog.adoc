===== changelog

Renders a change log for this promotion run.

The "to build" is the one being promoted.
 
The "from build" is the last build (before this one) having been promoted to the associated
promotion level.

If no such previous build is found on the associated branch, the search will be done
across the whole project, unless the `acrossBranches` configuration parameter is set to `false`.

If `project` is set to a comma-separated list of strings, the change log will be rendered 
for the recursive links, in the order to the projects being set (going deeper and deeper
in the links). 

Applicable for:

* promotion run
