=== Working with SCM

Source Control Management (SCM) is at the core of Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery chains. It's therefore not
a surprise that they play a major role in Ontrack.

// Out of the box, several SCM are supported:

//* <<usage-git,Generic Git repositories>>
//* <<usage-github,GitHub Cloud & Enterprise>>
//* <<usage-gitlab,GitLab>>
//* <<usage-bitbucket,Bitbucket Cloud & Server>>
