=== Notifications

Ontrack has the possibility to send send notifications to different <<notifications-backends,backends>> like some webhooks, email, Slack messages, etc.

A notification is the association between an _event_ occurring on an _entity_ and sent to a given _backend_ using some _configuration_.

For example, a notification can be:

* event: a build has been <<model,promoted>>
* entity: the branch the build <<model,belongs to>>
* backend: email
* backend configuration: the subject & the email addresses

In this example, the body of the email would be a text like "Build B of branch R in project P has been promoted to P", which various links to Ontrack.

Administrators of Ontrack can create and configure the different <<notifications-backends,backends>>. They can also configure the notifications at entity level to respond to some events using notification configurations (<<notifications-subscriptions,_subscriptions_>>). Subscriptions can be either <<notifications-subscriptions-local,local>> (subscribing to the events on a given branch) or <<notifications-subscriptions-global,global>> (subscribing to the events in all Ontrack, regardless of the entity).
