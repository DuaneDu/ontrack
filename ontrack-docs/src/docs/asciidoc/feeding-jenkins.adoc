=== Jenkins plug-in

If you're using https://jenkins.io[Jenkins] as a CI engine, you can either use the https://github.com/jenkinsci/ontrack-plugin[Ontrack Jenkins plug-in] or the <<feeding-jenkins-library,Ontrack Jenkins pipeline library>>.

[[feeding-jenkins-plugin]]
==== Jenkins plug-in

The https://github.com/jenkinsci/ontrack-plugin[Ontrack Jenkins plug-in] relies on API to inject data into Ontrack.

For example, to create a build:

[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            // ...
            // Computes the `version` variable
            // ...
            post {
                success {
                    ontrackBuild(
                        project: 'my-project',
                        branch: 'my-branch',
                        build: version,
                    )
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

[WARNING]
====
The https://github.com/jenkinsci/ontrack-plugin[Ontrack Jenkins plug-in] will be deprecated at some point, in favor of using the <<feeding-jenkins-library,Ontrack Jenkins pipeline library>> described below.
====

[[feeding-jenkins-library]]
==== Jenkins pipeline library

The Ontrack Jenkins pipeline library wraps the <<feeding-cli,Ontrack CLI>> into convenient pipeline steps.

[NOTE]
====
To be implemented. As much as possible, the pipeline library will mimic the steps which were provided by the <<feeding-jenkins-plugin,Jenkins plug-in>>.
====

For example, to create a build:

[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            // ...
            // Computes the `version` variable
            // ...
            post {
                success {
                    ontrackBuild(
                        project: 'my-project',
                        branch: 'my-branch',
                        build: version,
                    )
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
