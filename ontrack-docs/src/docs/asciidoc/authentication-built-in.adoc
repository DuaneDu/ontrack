=== Built-in authentication

Ontrack comes with its own registry to store accounts. In particular, it contains the built-in `admin` user.

[NOTE]
====
While having a fallback `admin` user, it's not recommended to use the built-in authentication for the rest of the users. Privilegiate using either the <<authentication-ldap,LDAP>> or <<authentication-openid,OIDC>> integrations for production usage.
====

No configuration is needed to enable the built-in authentication.

To create and manage accounts, go to your user menu and select _Account management_.

When user are connected using the built-in authentication mechanism, they are able to change their password using the _Change password_ user menu.

[NOTE]
====
Administrators can _lock_ built-in users so they cannot change their password; this is needed to create fixed guest accounts.
====

For the management of built-in accounts, see <<administration-accounts>>.
