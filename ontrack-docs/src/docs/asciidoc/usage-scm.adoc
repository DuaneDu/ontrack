=== Working with SCM

Source Control Management (SCM) is at the core of Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery chains. It's therefore not
a surprise that they play a major role in Ontrack.

Out of the box, several SCM are supported:

* Git based systems
** <<usage-git,Generic Git repositories>>
** <<usage-github,GitHub Cloud & Enterprise>>
** <<usage-gitlab,GitLab>>
** <<usage-bitbucket,BitBucket Cloud & Server>>
* <<usage-subversion,Subversion>>

[WARNING]
====
As of version 3.41, Subversion is now _deprecated_ and support
for it will be removed in version 4.x
