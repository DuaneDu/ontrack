==== Git searches

The Git Ontrack extension provides 3 <<extending-search,search indexers>>:

* looking for Ontrack branches based on the name of the Git branch
* looking for commits (using hashes, authors, description, ...)
* looking issues mentioned in commit messages (issue key)

The following configuration properties are available to run the Git search capabilities:

----
# How often the full-reindexation of commit must be performed
# The schedule is either a number of minutes, or can use
# a notation duration, like 1h, 60m, 1d, etc.
# Even for big volumes, 1 hour is more than enough.
ontrack.config.search.git.commits.schedule = 1h

# Set to false to disable the automated regular indexation
# of Git commits. If disabled, the indexation job is still present
# but must be run manually.
ontrack.config.search.git.commits.scheduled = true
