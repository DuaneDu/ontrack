[[api]]
== Ontrack API

[[api-graphql]]
=== Ontrack GraphQL API

[[api-dsl]]
=== Ontrack DSL

Up to version 4.5, a Groovy DSL was shipped and published with each Ontrack release.

This has changed since version 4.6:

|===
| Version | DSL

|4.5
| DSL is still published in the Maven Central and maintained

|4.6
| DSL is no longer published, but old versions should still be compatible with 4.x

| 5.x
| The DSL code is gone from Ontrack and no backward compatibility is insured any longer.
|===

To replace the Ontrack DSL, several alternatives are possible:

* direct calls to the GraphQL API
* using the https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack-cli[Ontrack CLI]
* using the https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack-jenkins-cli-pipeline[Jenkins Ontrack pipeline library]
* using <<feeding-github-ingestion,GitHub ingestion>>
