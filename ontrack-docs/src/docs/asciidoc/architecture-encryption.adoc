==== Encryption

Ontrack will store secrets, typically passwords and tokens, together with
the configurations needed to connect to external applications: Git, JIRA, etc.

In order to protect the integrity of those external applications, those secrets
must be protected.

Ontrack does so by encrypting those secrets in the database, using the
`AES128` algorithm. The `EncryptionService` is used for encryption.

The key needed for the encryption is stored and retrieved using a
`ConfidentialStore` service.
