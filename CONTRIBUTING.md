# Contribution Guidelines

To start a discussion, simply create an issue.

The work on `master` and `develop` is on hold at the moment except for bug fixes, given that most of the recent effort is going through the work on version 4. Please target `v4/develop` or even `release/4.0-beta` branches for new features.

You can submit new features/bug fixes by forking this repository and submitting a pull request. Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Update the documentation at need.
